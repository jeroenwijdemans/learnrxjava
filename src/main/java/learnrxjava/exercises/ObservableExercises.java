/**
 * Now that you have mastered the ComposableList, it is time to move on.
 *
 * If you plunged directly into here, welcome!
 *
 * A summary of what you've skipped:
 * ComposableList introduces you gradually to functional composition and operators, using (and extending)
 * standard JDK collections.
 * Introduced operators are: forEach, map, filter, concatMap, reduce, zip. Some you implement yourself.
 * A few complex assignments require you to combine them wisely. Some exercises in here refer back to
 * ComposableList. In case you really need to, you may peek at ComposableListSolutions.
 *
 * Whatever path took you here; the exercises in this class will help you gain an understanding of Observables.
 * Before we go in depth about explaining what Observables are, first think of them as
 * ComposableLists or some other collection.
 * 
 * This means you can apply the same compositional methods (map, filter, etc) to 
 * Observables as to ComposableLists.
 *
 * An Observable is a lot like an Event as sent to the age-old JDK EventListener.
 * Like an Event, an Observable represents a sequence
 * of values that a data producer pushes to the consumer. However unlike an Event,
 * an Observable can signal to a listener that it has completed, and will send no more data.
 *
 * Observables can send data to consumers asynchronously. Observables are a sequence
 * of values, delivered one after the other. Therefore it's possible that an Observable
 * can go on sending data to a listener forever just like an infinite stream.
 *
 * Querying (pull-based) Lists only gives us a snapshot. By contrast, querying (push-based)
 * Observables allows us to create data sets that react and update as the system changes over time. This
 * enables a very powerful type of programming known as reactive programming.

     * based, which turns things around. Now the producer (the Observable) chooses

     * event, i.e. the reception of a new value.
     * <p/>
     * We specify how to react to such an event by supplying the Observable with
     * a subscription, by invoking Observable.subscribe(). On this subscription we
     * give the Observable a handle ('callback') to use when it has another value,
     * by passing in an instance of Subscriber (encapsulated in OnNext&lt;Integer&gt; here, for your
     * convenience).

     * to a replay (!) of movies watched so far. New movies can be pushed in. Movies older than 5 hours
     * must be expunged.
     * <p/>
     * Use your knowledge built up so far to find the required Subject implementation and creation method.
